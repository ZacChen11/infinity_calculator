Infinity scientific calculator for computing transcendental functions - a software engineering group project - IN PROGRESS

Entering a number.

When entering a number, pressing '+/-' will change the sign of the number. Pressing '.' place the decimal point in that number.

To do a calculation, follow these steps:

For calculating a simple function (with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and x^y):

1. Enter the first number. 
2. Enter the second number.
3. Enter the desired operation.
4. The calculator will display the result in the bottom screen.

So for example, to get the result of '45 - 5', presse the number '45', then '5', then '-', which will print out the result in the bottom screen (i.e. '40'). Note that division by zeo will result in an error.

For calculating a complex function (sin, cos, e^, 10^, ln, log and square root):

1. Enter the first number.
2. Enter the desired operation.
3. The calculator will display the result in the bottom screen.

So for example, to get the result of '10^5', presse the number '10^', then '5', which will print out the result in the bottom screen (i.e. '10000'). Note that sin and cos will calculate their values in radians.
